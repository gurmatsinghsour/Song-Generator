1. Project Overview

This project, "AI Song Generator," is an advanced generative AI system designed to transform user-defined text prompts into complete musical compositions. The core innovation lies in its dual-path approach to lyric generation, offering users a choice between lyrics created by a custom-trained neural network and those generated by a state-of-the-art, fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM).

The goal is to create an end-to-end pipeline: a user provides a high-level creative brief (e.g., "a melancholic pop song about a lost love in a big city"), and the system delivers not only multiple lyrical interpretations but also a final, listenable audio track. This project builds upon foundational concepts of song classification and elevates them into the domain of advanced content generation.
2. System Architecture & Workflow

The application operates on a clear, multi-stage workflow designed for modularity and scalability.

    Frontend (User Interface): A clean web interface where the user inputs their creative prompt. The prompt will include key parameters such as genre, mood, theme, and optional keywords.

    Backend (Processing Core): A Python-based server (using Flask or FastAPI) orchestrates the entire generation process.

    Lyric Generation (Dual Model): Upon receiving the prompt, the backend triggers two parallel processes for lyric generation:

        Artisan AI (Custom Model): A custom-trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, built from the ground up and trained on a massive, curated dataset of over 100,000 song lyrics. This model represents a deep-dive into the fundamentals of sequence generation.

        Maestro AI (Fine-Tuned Model): A powerful, pre-trained Transformer-based model (leveraging the Gemini API or a fine-tuned open-source model like GPT-2/Llama) that is prompted to generate highly coherent, polished, and context-aware lyrics.

    User Selection: The two sets of generated lyrics are presented back to the user on the frontend, allowing them to select the version that best fits their vision.

    Music Generation: The user's chosen lyrics, along with the initial prompt's metadata (genre, mood), are sent to an open-source Text-to-Music model (e.g., Meta's MusicGen or Riffusion). This model generates a cohesive instrumental track that matches the specified style.

    Final Output: The system produces a final audio file (.mp3 or .wav) and presents it to the user for playback and download.

3. Features

    Prompt-Based Generation: Users can define the genre, mood, and theme of their desired song.

    Dual Lyric Models: Unique ability to choose between a custom-built "Artisan" model and a high-performance "Maestro" model.

    Vast Knowledge Base: The custom model will be trained on a dataset of over 100,000 songs, ensuring a wide stylistic range.

    Data Validation: A rigorous data acquisition and cleaning pipeline ensures the training data is high-quality and free of artifacts.

    End-to-End Automation: A fully automated pipeline from text idea to playable audio.

    Open-Source & Free-to-Use: The entire stack is built on open-source technologies and free-tier APIs, making it a cost-effective solution.
