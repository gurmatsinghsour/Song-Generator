## Project Overview

This project, "AI Song Generator," is an advanced generative AI system designed to transform user-defined text prompts into complete musical compositions. The core innovation lies in its dual-path approach to lyric generation, offering users a choice between lyrics created by a custom-trained neural network and those generated by a state-of-the-art, fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM).

The goal is to create an end-to-end pipeline: a user provides a high-level creative brief (e.g., "a melancholic pop song about a lost love in a big city"), and the system delivers not only multiple lyrical interpretations but also a final, listenable audio track. This project builds upon foundational concepts of song classification and elevates them into the domain of advanced content generation.

## System Architecture & Workflow

1. **Frontend (User Interface)**  
   - Clean web interface for prompt entry (genre, mood, theme, keywords).
2. **Backend (Processing Core)**  
   - Python server (Flask/FastAPI) orchestrates generation.
3. **Lyric Generation (Dual Model)**  
   - Runs Artisan AI and Maestro AI in parallel.  
   - Presents both outputs for user selection.
4. **Music Generation**  
   - User-selected lyrics + prompt metadata fed into a Text-to-Music model (MusicGen or Riffusion).  
   - Generates a cohesive instrumental track.
5. **Final Output**  
   - Produces a downloadable audio file (`.mp3`/`.wav`) for playback.

## Features

- **Prompt-Based Generation:** Define genre, mood, theme, and keywords.  
- **Dual Lyric Models:** Choose between custom-trained and fine-tuned models.  
- **Extensive Dataset:** Trained on a curated corpus of 100,000+ lyrics.  
- **Data Validation:** Automated cleaning pipeline to ensure high-quality training data.  
- **End-to-End Automation:** From text prompt to playable audio in one click.  
- **Open-Source & Free-to-Use:** Built entirely on open-source technologies and free-tier APIs.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask / FastAPI  
- **Custom AI Model:** TensorFlow / PyTorch (LSTM/RNN)  
- **Fine-Tuned AI Model:** Gemini API / Hugging Face Transformers  
- **Music Generation:** MusicGen / Riffusion  
- **Data Acquisition:** Kaggle Datasets, Genius API  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Deployment (Optional):** Google Colab (training), Heroku / PythonAnywhere (hosting)

## Installation & Usage

1. Install the core dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Ensure your trained model files reside in the `Models/` folder and the tokenizer is available in `Tokenizer/tokenizer.pkl`.

3. Set your Gemini API key (optional for Gemini lyrics):

   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>
   ```

4. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

Use the `/generate` endpoint to retrieve lyrics from both models and then pass your preferred lyrics back to `/song` to create an `.mp3` file.

Example request/response sequence:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text": "I love the way you", "max_words": 30}' \
    http://localhost:8000/generate

# choose either the "local" or "gemini" lyrics from the response

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"lyrics": "<your chosen lyrics>"}' \
    http://localhost:8000/song --output song.mp3
```
