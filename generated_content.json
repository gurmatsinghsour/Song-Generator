    "prompt": "Our group name is Sweathog. The members are Gurmat from India, Minh from Vietnam, and Robert from Canada or as we like to say, the chaos engine, the GPT whisperer, and the wise elder of the squad.\nWe are AI developers. Gurmat handles the heavy complex stuff. Like, the kind of problems that make other people cry. He enjoys pain. Minh doesn’t believe in coding — he just opens ChatGPT and lets it write his entire life. He once tried to ask GPT what career he should have. It said \"therapy.\" Robert is laser-focused, suspiciously unbothered, and definitely not in his twenties. Closer to sixty, but don't worry — he still remembers how to open a Jupyter notebook. Most days.\nRobert loves garlic dosa from Anna Laxmi like it's a religion. Minh likes every food. Even the ones you’re not supposed to eat. Also, Minh is still figuring out his gender identity — one Slack message at a time. Meanwhile, Gurmat has debates with LLMs for fun and calls it “debugging.”\nWe are led (mentally or spiritually, who knows) by Zeeshan Ahmed, our NLP professor. He watches this circus and wonders where he went wrong.\nWrite a sarcastic, self-roasting anthem about our dynamic. It should feel chaotic, dysfunctional, mildly concerning, yet somehow weirdly productive. Make it in rap or hip-hop style with an ambient, euphoric vibe. Tone: playful, ironic, exaggerated, but disturbingly accurate. Basically, we want it to sound like a joke that’s dangerously close to being a documentary.",
